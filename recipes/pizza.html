<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Yeast:</strong> This thin crust pizza dough starts with one teaspoon of active dry yeast. </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Sugar and water:</strong> Activate the yeast in white sugar and lukewarm water.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Flour:</strong> crispy thin crust calls for all-purpose flour instead of bread flour.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Salt:</strong>Salt tightens the gluten structure, which strengthens the dough and makes it more elastic.</li>
    <br>
    <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>

    <li>¼ teaspoon white sugar</li>
    <br>
    <li>¾ cup lukewarm water</li>

    <br>
    <li>Combine 1 3/4 cups flour and salt in a large bowl. Pour in yeast mixture; mix well until dough comes together.</li>
    <br>
